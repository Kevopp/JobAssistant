# JobAssistant
Mobile application for count job hours with database created using Cordova framework and Chart.js. The idea has came from my fiancee when she changed a job and spent a few hours for counting how much time was in job. Sometimes she was wrong and gave a boss wrong results. With database user can check rapidly how much time spent a month or year ago and
in current month.
